        Parameters
        ----------

            The public flags value to convert. This can be either a class with a ``value`` attribute, a string or an integer.

        extras: Optional[List[Union[Badge, UnknownBadge]]]
            A list of extra badges to add to the list. i.e. ``Badge.NITRO`` is not included in the public flags, so you would need to add it manually.

        Returns
        -------
        List[Union[Badge, UnknownBadge]]
            A list of badges. If a badge is not known to the library, it will be returned as an :class:`UnknownBadge`.
